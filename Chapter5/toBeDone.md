### To Be Done
1.  pg 97: ex 1 - alter getint to push +/- back on input --> I think I did it, not sure, not even sure what is being asked or why that would be helpful
2.  pg 97: ex2 - write getfloat much like getint
3.  pg 107: lots and lots of string manipulation
  ex3: made but not tested
  ex4: wrote it, compiled it, segfaults when testing
  ex5: wrote it, compiled it, segfaults when testing
4.  pg 110: ex7 rewrite readlines to store them in an array instead of being alloc-ed into storage
5.  pg 114: ex9, rewrite dayOfYear and monthDay with pointers instead of indexing --> not sure what to do with that since the arrays in those are ints not strings
6.  pg 118: several exercises utilizing argc and argv
