### Still to do:

1. Figure out how to actually pass data into the string manipulation exercises
2. pg 16: function to print the value of EOF
3. pg 20: test ex8, do ex 9 & 10
4. pg 21: ex11 and fix errors in ex12
5. pg 23: what is c-'0'??
6. pg 24: both exercises -> histograms
7. pg 30: exercises, not sure what to do
8. pg 31: ex 18 & 19 (example from pg 29 already typed for reference)
9. pg 34: All end of chapter exercises
