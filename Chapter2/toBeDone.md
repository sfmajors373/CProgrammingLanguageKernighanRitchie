### Things that have yet to be done in this chapter
1.  pg 36: determine the range of various primitives
2.  pg 46: convert string of hexadecimal to its integer value - ex3, started but have issues
3.  pg 48: deleting characters from one string out of another string
3.  pg 48: ex4 --> What is going on with my function????  Why is it so broken???  Where is it getting these extra letters???
