### To Be Done

1.  Find a way to run/test ex1 
2.  pg 73: extend atof to handle scientific notation
3.  pg 79: lots of alterations to the calculator program
    - ex3: I think it should work for negatives, but I'm not sure
    - I did 3, 4, & 5, 6 - 10 still need done
4.  pg 83: modify gettop with an internal static variable so it doesn't need ungetch
5.  pg 88: make recursive itoa using ideas from printd (on previous page)
6.  pg 91: define macro for swap to swap two arguments of type t
